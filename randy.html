        <p>Hi, I'm Randy Joshua, a passionate developer. I love building web applications and learning new technologies.
            I am currently in my third year pursuing a degree in Microbiology, but my dedication to web development has led me to acquire extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks such as React. In addition to my academic background, I have independently worked on several projects where I developed responsive websites and collaborated with peers to improve the functionality of web applications. My strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail ensure that my code is optimized and maintains high performance across all platforms.
